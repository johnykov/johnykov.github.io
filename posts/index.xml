      <description>As typical NodeJS fan I&amp;rsquo;m not following closely their release notes. That&amp;rsquo;s why I go easy way and often read another bloggers posts. Seems that NodeJS blog or docs aren&amp;rsquo;t so comfortable to read. I found beautiful Pawel Grzybek blog with some handful NodeJS news. I find those useful and worth recommendation.&#xA;A few of interesting posts by Pawel:&#xA;You might not need Jest — the Node.js native test runner is great nodejs watch pnpm Looks like pnpm is gaining popularity and aims to be replacing npm.</description>

      <description>This post might have multiple titles. &amp;ldquo;How to speed up rails project CI build times&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;How to reduce docker images size&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;How to save planet by reducing carbon print with smaller docker containers&amp;rdquo; and so on.&#xA;Optimizing Continous Delivery process is somewhat of my passion. I think it&amp;rsquo;s the strong influence one book by Jez Humble&amp;rsquo;s put on me.&#xA;When I started helping VAS (first key OSO&amp;rsquo;s client) with going cloud I wrote TBH very inefficient process of release.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I&amp;rsquo;ve attended a DDD-WAW meetup with Andrzej Krzywda from Arkency which was great. Andrzej is a great guy. I’ve met him first time in real. Andrzej was talking about his programming career. He is a good storyteller. He was of course talking a lot about DDD and how they do it in Arkency. He showed off some examples. Pointed us to demo app of the DDD/CQRS/ES patterns applied - e-commerce .</description>

      <title>Rails ActiveRecord or DDD?</title>

      <description>Picking the right Rails code style Yesterday I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this amazing 8 years old video October CincyRb - Jim Weirich on Decoupling from Rails . The mentioned video presents interesting way of separating App Code - business domain core logic - from infrastructure, Rails (ActiveRecord) specific code. As I understand this is called DDD - Domain Driven Design. There are multiple books about this concept. Just google them if interested. Going against the main flow - with DDD Rails concept - requires a lot of discipline and patience to learn, teach and adapt the whole team to stick to it.</description>

      <title>Performance akka-http vs scalatra</title>
      <link>https://johnykov.github.io/bootzooka-akka-http-vs-scalatra.html</link>

      <guid>https://johnykov.github.io/bootzooka-akka-http-vs-scalatra.html</guid>
      <description>Some time ago we changed how Bootzooka handles HTTP requests. My goal is to compare two great tools:&#xA;complete web framework scalatra 2.3.1 (latest stable) called by one of it&amp;rsquo;s project leaders a web toolkit akka-http 2.4.2 from a performance perspective. I find both of them very helpful but they work in different ways so the idea is to see how much that impacts the application and it&amp;rsquo;s users.&#xA;Whenever you buy a car - you look at its specification.</description>

      <description>[2015-07-08] Update Bootzooka has been strongly simplified lately and there were some conceptual changes that is why this post is no longer valid. Also frontend part is being build by webpack now.&#xA;Outdated: At the beginning of my carrer in Softwaremill I was working on trial project for booking company. We were building demo app starting with bootzooka as a base. We&amp;rsquo;ve changed much in that code. After that experience I brought back some of them to bootzooka.</description>

      <title>Fabtools - Tomcat - fast provisioning</title>

      <description>As every other developer I&amp;rsquo;m a fun of easy developer life. I wish all open source projects could be build right away without any previous database or ldap mocking setup. Just fire it right away! That is why I like Vagrant so much.&#xA;Vagrant with puppet manifests [chef|ansible|bash] might help to completely separate your local development environment from office network. From now on you can work from the basement without network connection - is&amp;rsquo;t that sweet?</description>
